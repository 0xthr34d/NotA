# NotA
## Description
This is my course final proyect.

This app is about manage storages and the products inside these ones to have more control about the date or the mount of each product that you have.

## Functionality

When we start the app for first time, we can see a blank screen with a button to add new storages and two bottons in the toolbar to change the view.

To add a new storage, tap in '+' button, and a fragment will appear.
In this  Fragment que can select the type of storage and input the name of the storage.
To save or cancel the changes, there are two bottons in the toolbar.

Once added, the main fragment wil show the storage that we've just created.

The buttons in the toolbar can change the view of the storages, there are three types of view (I've created two more storages for the demostration):

- Grid

- List

- Detail (Each storage can be deleted swapping it)

And when a storage has been deleted, a snackbar appears in case that you delete a storage unintentionally

To manage the products of each storage, we simply touch in the storage that we want in non-edit mode.
In the new fragment appears a similar screen to storages but for products.

If we want to add a new product. we have to touch on the '+' button and a new fragment appears.
In this new fragment we can edit the data of the product. If we want to save or cancel changes there are two buttons in the toolbar.

And if we go back, we can see the products that we've added (i've added three more products for the demostration)

If we touch the button in the toolbar up to the right, the view change to detail view.

We can search products by touching the magnifying glass in the toolbar, searching the input inside de product's name.

If we want to delete a product, then swap to left

And when a product has been deleted, a snackbar appears in case that you delete a product unintentionally

But if we swipe the product to the right, we can move the product to other storage (it can move one or more products at once).

When we swipe the product, the toolbar change to mode contextual, and show the number of products that we want to move.
