# NotA
## Description
This is my course final proyect.

This app is about manage storages and the products inside these ones to have more control about the date or the mount of each product that you have.

## Functionality

When we start the app for first time, we can see a blank screen with a button to add new storages and two bottons in the toolbar to change the view.

To add a new storage, tap in '+' button, and a fragment will appear.
In this  Fragment que can select the type of storage and input the name of the storage.
To save or cancel the changes, there are two bottons in the toolbar.

Once added, the main fragment wil show the storage that we've just created.

The buttons in the toolbar can change the view of the storages, there are three types of view (I've created two more storages for the demostration):

- Grid

And when a storage has been deleted, a snackbar appears in case that you delete a storage unintentionally
